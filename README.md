# Devcom-TestTask
This is my test task for Devcom. Hopefully, i will pass code review XD

Here we have a Java app that allows to open Images and cropp them into puzzle pieces. These tiny images are mixed and rotated in random way, to make the game look like a puzzle.
App gives u opportunity to save ur puzzle, open ur previous puzzle, check if u solved the puzzle.

Also the size of each tile depends on the size of the initial size of the picture and is scaled to fit the window frame.
Tiles are divided to 2 types: 1 - rectangle, 2 - square - child of rectangle. The difference - rotation abilities, square can be rotated 4 different direction, when rectangle only 2.

One of the features is an ability to switch themes. If u think main (white) theme is to bright, u can switch to grey, or black themes.
I'm glad, I tried, but sad, this project won't let me get a job.
Cheers if u read till the end, have a beautiful day :)
